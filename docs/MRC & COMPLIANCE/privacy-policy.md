## WHO WE ARE

Protected is a software company that works with Web Asset Owners to help them detect fraudulent behaviour in relation to digital advertising on their website, application, advertising media and other digital properties (“Digital Properties“). To do this Protected collects personal data on online users, through the Platform; all in order to help Web Asset Owners identify fraudulent and invalid activities . Reducing fraudulent and invalid activity increases faith in digital advertising.Protected, whilst part of the ad-tech eco-system, is not an advertising company. We do not share individual consumer profiles or buy, sell or targeted online advertising, and thus, our disclosure of personal data is very limited (as set out further in the section marked “Who we share personal data with”).

## What do we mean by personal data?

“Personal Data” is defined as any data relating to a living individual who can be identified directly from that data or indirectly in conjunction with other information.  It can take the form of a name or address and, now, under new data protection laws in Europe, this can extend to uniquely generated IDs, IP addresses and other “unique identifiers”.We cannot identify an online user by name, or find out where they live, but instead it gives us a picture of how a user interacts with a Digital Property which we may assign to a user of our Platform.

## PERSONAL DATA WE COLLECT, AND HOW AND WHY WE COLLECT IT

### Personal data we collect

As part of our Services, we collect and process the following information:

* HTTP header data (including Digital Property address, operating system, plug in,)..

<br />

The combination of this information, with a unique identifier is personal data. We do not collect and process any Special personal data.

### How do we collect personal data?

Protected Services may use pixels, javascript, flash codes, and other similar technologies that can place a code on a Digital Property to collect information about content interaction.
