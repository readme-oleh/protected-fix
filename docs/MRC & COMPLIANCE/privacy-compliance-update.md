Dear Valued partner,

We are delighted to share some important news with you. At Protected Media, we are committed to staying proactive and safeguarding your interests as perceptions and privacy regulations evolve.

To address growing concerns surrounding specific IVT detection techniques, such as using cookies and local storage in browsers, we have changed our default behavior, effective June 7/8. Our new default configuration will no longer include these techniques.

Rest assured, our team has worked diligently to develop substitute methodologies that minimize the impact on IVT detection. While the modifications were created to align with privacy regulations and public sentiment, we remain dedicated to ensuring the efficacy of our verification services.

If you prefer to continue using the mentioned techniques, you have the option to do so by adding a specific value to the configuration of your relevant traffic. This flexibility allows you to tailor the settings for different traffic sources to your unique requirements.

For detailed information regarding the data and configuration options specific to your traffic sources, we encourage you to contact your TAM (technical account manager). They will provide the necessary details and support to help you make informed decisions that align with your advertising objectives.

We are excited about these changes as they reflect our proactive efforts to adapt to the evolving landscape. By embracing privacy-conscious practices, we can continue protecting your interests while fostering trust and engagement with your target audience.

Thank you for your continued partnership and trust in Protected Media. If you have any questions or require further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us.

Here's to a privacy-centric future and your continued success!
