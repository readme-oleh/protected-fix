The Escalation process is designed to offer formal guidelines in cases there’s a dispute/disagreement between Protected Media’s IVT detection and the said source of traffic.Typically, these types of disputes are communicated to the PM team via the direct client who’s using PM’s services. Each of PM’s clients has a dedicated CSM who’s available via multiple channels. PM’s offers a Discrepancy management process to suggest and advise on correct and formal discrepancy assessment.
An entity can approach PM indirectly (i.e. not via PM’s client) for the purpose of challenging PM’s detection in cases relevant to its supplied media, via any channel (PM’s website, PM’s general email for this kind of inquiries, or a direct approach to a PM employee, etc’).
In order for PM to attend to this request, PM must require formal consent from the relevant client who’s connected to said entity. PM will not disclose information without the express consent of the client.
